## General Information
- Aim:
	Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and How well those variables describe the bike demand.
- Background:
	The company is US bike-sharing provider Boom Bikes and it provide a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
- Business Problem:
	Required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- Provided dataset
	Complete bike data having bikes used count between the time period 2018 to 2019.

## Conclusions
- Year, Holiday, Temperature, Windspeed , few Months( 'Dec', 'Jan', 'Jul', 'Nov', 'Sep) , some climatic conditions( 'Heavy Rain', 'Light Rain') and seasons('Spring', 'Summer', 'Winter) plays an important factors in determining the chances of predicting the count of using bikes.
